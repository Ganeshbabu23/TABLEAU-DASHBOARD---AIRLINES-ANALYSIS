# TABLEAU-DASHBOARD---AIRLINES-ANALYSIS
This interactive dashboard analyzes airline load factors, flight distribution, and passenger trends to identify efficient carriers, busy routes, and travel patterns—offering insights to optimize operations and support better decision-making.


# ✈️ Highcloud Dashboard - Airline Load Factor Analysis

## 📌 Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to create an interactive dashboard that analyzes and visualizes key airline performance metrics, particularly **load factor**. Load factor is an essential indicator of how efficiently airlines are filling their available seats.

This dashboard helps users understand which carriers are performing well, how distance affects flight frequency, the difference in traffic between weekdays and weekends, and much more.

## 🎯 Project Goals & Questions

### ✅ What was the goal?
To analyze airline performance using load factor and flight distribution data, and present it in a clear, interactive dashboard.

### 🔍 What was the approach?
- Load and clean airline data
- Create relevant KPIs (total passengers, total distance, total airlines, etc.)
- Design interactive visualizations using Tableau
- Analyze trends, patterns, and relationships in the data

### 📊 What did we find?
- Delta and Southwest are highly efficient in terms of load factor
- Short-haul routes dominate the total number of flights
- Most passengers travel on weekdays
- A positive trend in load factor percentage from 2008 to 2013

### 💡 Why does it matter?
- Improve airline profitability by managing capacity
- Optimize flight schedules
- Provide data-driven insights for strategic planning

## 📈 Load Factor - Simple Definition

**Load Factor** = Transported Passengers ÷ Available Seats

It measures how efficiently an airline is using its seating capacity.  
Higher load factor = fewer empty seats = better revenue and operational efficiency.
